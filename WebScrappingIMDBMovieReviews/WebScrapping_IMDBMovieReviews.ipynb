    "The focus of this notebook is to demonstate how to go about scrapping movie reviews, and rating from imdb. Reviews scrapped on  this Notebook will be used down the line for clustering and topic modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "one positive and one negative review are scrapped for 190 movies  for a total of ~ 380 reviews. For this analysis, a positive review is considered to be a review with a review rating of greater than 7/10 where as a negative review is a review with a rating less than 5/10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some basic EDA and data visualization is performed on the ratings for the movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reviews collected are then cleaned following the same text cleaning approaches discuss discussed in previous notebooks leveraging `TextCleaningToolkit.py`. The review preprocessing approach includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Break review into sentences/lines\n",
    "2. Change sentences to lower case\n",
    "3. Expland contractions for each sentence. Turning shortforms like Can't to Can not\n",
    "4. NP Chunk from pattern.en import parsetree \n",
    "5. Break lines into tokens\n",
    "6. Remove punctuation marks\n",
    "7. remove stopwords\n",
    "8. Perform lemmatization\n",

    "For my scrappying, I chose to scrape actions movies from url \"https://www.imdb.com/search/title?title_type=feature&user_rating=3.5,&num_votes=10000,&genres=action&sort=user_rating,desc\". This filter returns 1,813 action movies titles with IMDB rating >3.5 and number of votes >10000. This gives me the flexiblity to select best and worst movies based on IMDB rating and also to have some data to perform some visualisation as shown below. After pulling the movie list, I saved it in an pandas objectto avoid having to rerun the query which could take a while."
